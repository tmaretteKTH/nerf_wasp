## Datasets

I found this Universal NER project that came out this year. Some links: [website](https://www.universalner.org/), [research paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2311.09122v2), [git](https://github.com/UniversalNER)

> Universal Named Entity Recognition (UNER) aims to fill a gap in multilingual NLP: high quality NER datasets in many languages with a shared tagset.
> 
> UNER is modeled after the Universal Dependencies project, in that it is intended to be a large community annotation effort with language-universal guidelines. Further, we use the same text corpora as Universal Dependencies.

Basically, it seems to be what [scandiNER](https://huggingface.co/saattrupdan/nbailab-base-ner-scandi) did, but cleaner and more accessible.


All datas are in [IOB2 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside%E2%80%93outside%E2%80%93beginning_(tagging))

They seem to have Swedish/Norwegian/Danish for now. We could replace Icelandic/Faroese by german?
